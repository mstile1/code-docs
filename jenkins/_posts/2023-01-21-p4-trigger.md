Setting this up has been more difficult than anticipated. Here are some notes and possible troubleshooting tips.

&nbsp;

### How the system ultimately works:
1. User submits changelist to Perforce.
2. Perforce fires a trigger which executes a 'script' you've set.
 - 'script' can be a batch file, exe, bash script... whatever you prefer.
3. The script sends a json payload to the Jenkins endpoint.
4. Jenkins authenticates and validates the payload.
5. All 'Perforce Triggered Builds' are notified to poll Perforce and build if necessary.

&nbsp;

### Jenkins Build Settings
1. You may want to have a dedicated user added to Perforce for Jenkins. (likely isn't critical)
2. Add a credential in Jenkins to enable p4 access.
 - click on global->Add Credentials
 - Kind: Perforce Password Credential
 - ID, Description: e.g. 'p4_access'
 - **P4Port must match the final http post**
 - Username/Password: can use jenkins p4 user login (or user with checkout privileges)

3. In your Jenkins project's configuration, choose the new credentials for  
'Perforce Software->Perforce Credentials'.
4. Make sure 'Perforce Triggered Build' is checked under 'Build Triggers'.

&nbsp;

### Do a preliminary check
1. Make sure your project actually has changes to build. (you may need to submit something benign)
2. Go to the Jenkins dashboard and click on P4 Trigger.
3. Enter the **correct p4port**, any change number, click 'Trigger'.
 - (Note: as of writing this change number isn't used, the builds still poll Perforce and check pending changes)
4. Your project should automatically start.

### Jenkins user authentication
1. API Token->'Add New Token' for an admin user.

2. Copy the token generated, it will be needed for the curl request.

&nbsp;

### Setting up the curl request
###### depot/tools/p4/trigger_jenkins_build.bat
```batch
SET change=%1

SET p4port=<host-name>:1666
SET endpoint=http://<host-name>:8080/p4/change
SET user=bfix
SET token=4234kjkjapitoken42klj4k23j4l2

curl --request POST ^
    --user %user%:%token% ^
    --json "payload={\"change\":\"%change%\", \"p4port\":\"%p4port%\"}" ^
    %endpoint%
```
1. Create a new file for your script.
- I chose a batch file but can be any executable
- you could likely even embed the whole command in the p4 trigger (see below)
1. *change*: the changelist passed as an argument to the script by the p4 trigger
2. *p4port*: must be an exact match to the P4Port in the Jenkins credential
 - (just a string comparison)
3. *user*:*token*: are for the api token created in Jenkins
 - this will authenticate the request
4. *payload*: 'change' and 'p4port' fields are required
 - **Note: if Jenkins doesn't like the json formatting, there may be no error provided**
5. (Note: --json is only available in later versions of curl, otherwise you would use --header and --data)

&nbsp;

### Set up Perforce Trigger
1. Go to command line, type `p4 triggers`
2. It should open a text file in a text editor with all the help info for the command.
3. The last line should be Triggers:
4. Add an indented entry containing the necessary elements to run your script.
 - `name` `trigger-event` `p4-path-that-executes-trigger` `script-to-run-with-change-arg`
```
Triggers:
    jenkins change-commit //depot/... "%//depot/tools/p4/trigger_jenkins_build.bat% %change%"
```
5. Save the file and close the text editor.
6. P4 triggers should be updated. You can check by typing `p4 triggers -o`.

&nbsp;

### Cross your fingers...
If you've set up everything exactly right, when you check in a file your Jenkins builds will build.

Some troubleshooting tips:
 - Make sure the p4port strings match.
 - If authentication fails, this should show in Jenkins error logs and in the curl result.
 - If json isn't formatted correctly, there may be no error, but builds will not trigger.
 - You CAN add a logger in Jenkins to see a bit more information.
  - When adding a logger, type 'p4' and choose the log you care about, e.g. 'org.jenkinsci.plugins.p4'.
 - It's unclear from documentation if the 'change' field is even used, but it makes sense that it should at least be higher than the last changelist your Jenkins project synced and built at.
