Setting this up has been more difficult than anticipated. Here are some notes and possible trouble shooting tips.

### How the system ultimately works:
1. A user submits a changelist to Perforce.
2. Perforce executes a trigger that you've set up to run a script
 - 'script' = batch command, exe, bash script... whatever you prefer
3. The script sends a json payload to the Jenkins endpoint
4. Jenkins authorizes and validates the payload
5. All 'Perforce Triggered Builds' are notified to poll Perforce and build if necessary.

### Jenkins Build Settings
1. You may want to have a dedicated user added to Perforce for Jenkins. This likely isn't necessary.
2. Add a credential in Jenkins to enable p4 access.
 - click on global->Add Credentials
 - Kind: Perforce Password Credential
 - ID, Description: e.g. 'p4_access'
 - **P4Port must match the final http post**
 - Username/Password: can use jenkins p4 user login (or user with checkout privileges)

3. In a build's configuration, choose these new credentials for 'Perforce Software->Perforce Credentials'.
4. Make sure 'Perforce Triggered Build' is checked under 'Build Triggers'

### Jenkins user authorization
1. API Token->'Add New Token' for an admin user.

2. Copy the token generated, it will be needed for the curl request.
